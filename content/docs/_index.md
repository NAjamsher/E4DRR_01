## Running a Local Test Setup

To run a test setup locally, ensure you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
   cd path/to/E4DRR.github.io

```

3. Start the Hugo server:

```
    hugo server
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address displayed in the terminal to view the site.

## Deployment

The project is configured to deploy using GitHub Actions. Follow these steps to ensure successful deployment:

1. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings and configured to use the `gh-pages` branch.
2. Push your changes to the `main` branch. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the site.

The GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` is configured as follows:

```
name: Deploy website to GitHub Pages

env:
  WC_HUGO_VERSION: "0.125.2"

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub.
  workflow_dispatch:

# Provide permission to clone the repo and deploy it to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build website
  build:
    if: github.repository_owner != 'HugoBlox'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # Fetch history for Hugo's .GitInfo and .Lastmod
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v3
        with:
          hugo-version: ${{ env.WC_HUGO_VERSION }}
          extended: true
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: /tmp/hugo_cache_runner/
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-hugomod-${{ hashFiles('**/go.mod') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-hugomod-
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Build with Hugo
        env:
          HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
        run: |
          echo "Hugo Cache Dir: $(hugo config | grep cachedir)"
          hugo --minify --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"
      - name: Generate Pagefind search index
        run: npx pagefind --source "public"
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./public

  # Deploy website to GitHub Pages hosting
  deploy:
    if: github.repository_owner != 'HugoBlox'
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

```

3. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow under the "Actions" tab in your repository to ensure the build and deployment processes complete successfully.

4. Once the workflow completes, your site should be live on GitHub Pages. You can verify this by visiting the URL specified in your repository's GitHub Pages settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Error: nil pointer evaluating resource.Resource.Process

- **Cause:** This error typically occurs when an image or resource is not correctly referenced in the template or content files. Hugo is trying to process a resource that doesn't exist or is incorrectly specified, leading to a nil pointer evaluation.
- **Solution:**
  1. **Check References:** Ensure that all images and resources are correctly referenced in your content files. Verify that the paths are accurate and relative to the site's root or the specific page.
  2. **File Existence:** Confirm that the referenced files actually exist in the specified directories.
  3. **Debugging:** Add debug statements or logs in your templates to trace where the nil pointer is occurring. This can help identify the exact reference causing the issue.
  4. **Example Fix:**
     ```markdown
     ![Alt text](/images/example.jpg)
     ```
     Ensure `/images/example.jpg` exists in the `static` directory of your Hugo project.

#### Error: No such file or directory @ dir_chdir

- **Cause:** This error indicates that the specified directory does not exist or the path is incorrect in your configuration or script. It often happens when the deployment or build scripts are looking for a directory that hasn't been created or is misnamed.
- **Solution:**
  1. **Verify Paths:** Double-check all directory paths specified in your configuration files (e.g., `config.toml`, `config.yaml`) and deployment scripts.
  2. **Create Missing Directories:** Ensure that all required directories are created before running the build or deployment process. For example, if a directory is dynamically created during the build process, make sure the script includes steps to create it.
  3. **Correct Directory Names:** Ensure there are no typos or case sensitivity issues in the directory names.
  4. **Example Fix:**
     ```yaml
     destination: /github/workspace/docs/_site
     ```
     Ensure `/github/workspace/docs` exists and is correctly named.

#### GitHub Pages build failure

- **Cause:** Build failures on GitHub Pages can be due to several issues, including misconfigurations in the GitHub Actions workflow file, incorrect repository settings, or issues with the Hugo site configuration.
- **Solution:**

  1. **Workflow Configuration:**

     - Ensure that your GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) is correctly set up. Check for syntax errors and ensure all necessary steps are included.
     - Example snippet:

       ```yaml
       name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages

       on:
         push:
           branches:
             - main # Set to the branch you want to deploy from

       jobs:
         build:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest

           steps:
             - name: Checkout repository
               uses: actions/checkout@v2

             - name: Setup Hugo
               uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
               with:
                 hugo-version: "0.125.5"
                 extended: true

             - name: Build the site
               run: hugo --minify

             - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
               uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
               with:
                 github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                 publish_dir: ./public
       ```

  2. **GitHub Pages Settings:**
     - Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings. Navigate to the repository's settings, find the "Pages" section, and make sure it is set to build from the `gh-pages` branch or any other branch you specified.
  3. **Check Repository Configuration:**
     - Verify that the branch specified in the workflow (`main` in the example) is correct and matches the branch from which you are pushing changes.
     - Ensure the `publish_dir` specified in the workflow matches the output directory of your Hugo build.
  4. **Debug Logs:**
     - Enable debug logs in your GitHub Actions workflow to get more detailed error messages. This can help identify specific issues during the build or deployment process.
